- Opinionated `createDetector` client with presets (`web`, `ssr`, `native`, `test`) and privacy modes.- Pluggable cache adapters with configurable TTL via `configureCache` and preset client configuration.- Observability hooks with correlation IDs and audit trails for each detection run.- Deterministic privacy mode that disables async probes and client hints while allowing sanitized overrides.- Plugin contract support (`apply`, `name`, `version`) for safe, extensible detections.
